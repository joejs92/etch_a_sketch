# etch_a_sketch
The etch-a-sketch project for Odin. It is completed to the specifications of the project, except the grid blocks aren't exactly squares. In order to make them squares I would have to play with the margins or something.
In the future I could create a square div in the middle of the page and have all the grids lie within that. I mean, they all essentially take on the dimensions of whatever container they are in, so if I force the 
container to be a square, then the blocks should be a square. Before moving onto the next course I should go back and beautify this a little more, if for no other reason than to get more exposure to js and css.
